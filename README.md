## Tech Used


### Mobile Application
1. Flutter: flutter which is a great framework to build cross platform applications for iOS, Android, Mac and Windows is used to build the mobile application.

2. Provider: For state management of prompts, provider is used. This is similar to react redux to ensure that data management is efficient.



### AI API
1. Node.js: Yoda AI's backend is powered by Node.js, a fast and scalable JavaScript runtime. Node.js enables seamless handling of requests and provides a foundation for building robust server-side applications.

2. Express.js: Express.js, a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework, is used for building the API endpoints that power Yoda AI's interactions. It simplifies routing, middleware integration, and request handling.

3. TypeScript: TypeScript is the language of choice for Yoda AI's codebase. It adds static typing to JavaScript, enhancing code quality, maintainability, and developer productivity.

4. AWS Lambda: Yoda AI takes advantage of AWS Lambda, a serverless computing service, to host and execute its backend functions. AWS Lambda ensures high availability and scalability without the need to manage infrastructure.

5. Serverless Framework: The Serverless Framework streamlines the deployment and management of serverless applications, including AWS Lambda functions, making development more efficient.

6. Docker: Docker containers are used for local development and testing, ensuring consistency between development and production environments.

7. Langchain, LLMs & OpenAI: I started by using OpenAI to build the AI and I will include a branch called llm which has code for the same using Langchain and LLMs.


## Extras
I build a similar API to this in Golang. You can find it here in my github.
